Books are just, *amazing*. They give us a look into so much more perspectives, thoughts and ideas to ponder upon and reflect (*and enjoy*). 💚

Although I was always the kind of person who would read books, it was only about an year back when I started reading books *effectively*.

Earlier, I would just read them, understand the plot, and move on. After making a few changes in my reading method and routine, I'm now able to really dive into the story (*or the idea*) and also read so much more books at the same time.

### The few "changes" 💡

- **If you don't seem to like the book, close it and move on**: Alot of people get this *guilt* of having to stop reading a book, once they start one, even if they don't like it (*it is probably an idea that our education system taught us*). If you don't seem to like a book or enjoy it, treat it as you would with any YouTube video; close that book, find a new book, and move on. 🚶
- **Take notes**: This might be a little hard on for casual readers, but it is definitely effective. Especially if you are reading non-fiction books, try to make notes for the main ideas and thoughts in the book, so that you could *highlight* the idea into your mind too. For Kindle Readers, this is really easy to do too. (**Try it out!**) 📝
- **Listen to Audiobooks**: Many of us live the busy-wagon lives with infinite tasks in our to-do lists. Try out audiobooks. They are the best ways you could **effectively** *listen* to a book when you are commuting, working, etc. (*Though, I suggest doing this mainly for ficiton books only*) 🔊
- **Find time to read**: Always try to find time to read a book. Be it an hour, 30 minutes, or even 5 minutes! Creating a routine where you find time to read a book, effectively makes your *beautiful mind* committed to new ideas and thoughts. (*I personally suggest reading atleast for 5 minutes before you sleep. This way you could avoid looking at bluescreen before you sleep too!*) 🕰
- **Try out new genres**: Many of us stay put on reading books of a particular genre (*Self-Help, Literary Fiction, and so on*). Try to get out of your comfort-zone and read a book of a totally different genre. 

## Quote 💭

I'll end this blog by this beautiful quote I read today from the book "*The War of Art*" By *Steven Pressfield* ✨:
