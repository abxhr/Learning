## My timeline as a Student ⏳

(**Disclaimer:** *I'll try to be as completely honest as possible so that you could have a good time reading the blog!*)

I was born and brought up in my homeland, *Kerala, India*, in this beautiful place called *Thalassery* (a place in the district of *Kannur*), known for the delicious *Thalassery Biriyani*. I did my Kindergarten there (*KG1 & KG2*). I was always the naughty one in the class. 🤓

Since *Grade - 1*, I've been here in the UAE. To be honest, it was quite difficult for me to fit in the beginning as I wasn't fluent with the language too, but then eventually caught up everything (*I remember when I was in grade - 2, I once struggled finding the word "Daughter" while speaking to a friend of mine. To just continue with the convo, I had to go ahead and kinda explain the word to him; "the girl version of a son"*) 😂 

*Grade - 3* was one of the most memorable year I had as a student. I made so many new friends, formed the "gang" and so on. 💛

My journey all the way till around *Grade - 9* was similar. I didn't care about studies. Scored bad (*like bad*). I was really naughty too (*I had to go to the headmaster's office I couple of times* 👀).

But then something happened; something even I don't know. Although the beginning of *Grade - 10* kinda felt similar to how it had been all along, I started becoming a different person towards the end of *Grade - 10*. I started studying. I was much more disciplined (*Although I continued bunking classes*). And somehow I started acing my exams. (*I still remember that I scored the highest in the school in a couple of subjects for my model examinations*). 💯 

I aced my *Grade - 10* Board Examinations too! 🎉

If you were to ask me what changed, or what me change, I really don't know. Perhaps its maybe a teacher I had, or my parents motivating me, but I really don't know the actual reason. 😅

Then came *Grade - 11* (*One of the 23423 "main" changing points in life as referred to by Indian Parents*). I took up science, cause I always loved it and never saw it as a "burden" while studying either.

I thought to apply for the Student Council in my School, then, for the position of the *Assistant Head Boy*. Although it seemed like a really long-shot for me, I thought to give it a go anyway. (*I had this amazing friend from grade - 2, who always aced his exams since and was the class monitor since grade - 1 and he had applied for the position too*) 👨

Teachers liked me. I gave my interview with the Chairman. And boom! I got selected for the position! 🎉

Although it seemed like a really great time for me, things soon changed. Situations came up where I wasn't doing mentally well. To point out an instance, I had a crazy supervisor who just didn't care what a student waws going through, even after being a part of the Council. 

Let's not go more into it, cause I like making these blog *positive*. 

Despite all that, I still maintained being the person I was. I scored well, became a good leader, and good student.

*Grade - 12* then came about. Being the last year in school, I worked hard and also spent time with a few amazing friends. As I was preparing for Competitive Exams, it was really stressful too; 6 hour classes, less hours of sleep, 13-14 hours of study and so on. 

I aced my Board Examinations! And did decent with my Competitive Exams too (*Although not that great too*) 

I joined BITS Pilani Dubai Campus soon after school. And I wasn't sure; I wasn't sure about how it would be for me, would it allow me to do things I want, and so on. But once I got into the campus, it all started slowly becoming clear for me. I made some *amazing* friends. I had great seniors helping and advicing me with everything. It was amazing! ⭐️

I still try to maintain the way I study while having fun at the same time. 

Once the *Pandemic* hit, things just went berserk. Online university just totally started holding me back. I started procrastinating (*alot. like alottt*). 🙁

But once reality hit me (*hit me real bad*), by the start of *Year - 2*, I slowly started working again to build up my career and to achieve my goals. 🙌

Through out the journey till now, I had so many *amazing* people who kept supporting and motivating me through whatever situation I went through; my parents, siblings, cousins, friends, teachers, and so on. 

And to them: Thank you. I genuinely appreciate you for everything you did for me. ❤️

I don't know where my journey ahead takes me as student, a friend, a son, or a person. But all I know is that I will always work hard and also try to become a better version of myself, *InShaAllah*. 💯
