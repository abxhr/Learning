## Check-in 📌

One of the million things that I like about Ramadan is that you get closer with your family. Be it if you are preparing the *Iftar*, grabbing groceries, praying together, or waking up late for *Suhoor* with 2 minutes left for *Fajr*, Ramadan brings more love and joy to a family through even the most trivial tasks. ♥️ 

Also, on a very different note, try this coding [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/) out, where you are asked to merge k-sorted lists. If you are familiar with merge sort, this problem will be a piece of cake for you! (*Although the time complexity in merging two sorted lists at a time is not ideal*). You could find my solution to the problem [here](https://github.com/abxhr/Coding-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/codes/23.py).
