   <em>My so-called wanderer friend</em>

I feel a little better from yesterday, but I'm still really tired and exhausted. 

This blog is going to be short too :(

The poem is one of my poems of all time (*You might be familiar with this poem from the movie Interstellar*)

  <em>
    <strong>Do not go gentle into that good night</strong><br>
    - by Dylan Thomas<br><br>
   Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
   Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>
   Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
   Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
   Do not go gentle into that good night.<br><br>
   Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
   Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>
   Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
   And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
   Do not go gentle into that good night.<br><br>
   Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
   Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>
   And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
   Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
   Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
   Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
