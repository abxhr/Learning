Looking back at the days you spent in your **school**, you never think about "Oh I scored *x* marks at *y* subject", or if you failed or passed an exam. The memories that you keep with you from that amazing place are probably the ones where you had too much fun, which led you to the Headmaster's office (*which did happen to me*).

Ah. I had these amazing bunch of friends too at school. And school would've been boring without them. Be it snacking on mini oreos and popcorn while the sir took the class, or having *all* kinds of fun during picnic, those amazing people made me happy, and made my school life an amazing one.

We realise how beautiful and joyful each of those moments were, once we are way past that moment in life. Just like those days, the moments that you spend now with your family or friends, could be something that you would keep safe in your memories, and someday, you would look back at these moments and smile. So make sure that you spend your time well with them, before those moments are long gone.

  <em>Have you for a moment taken a step back to think about those crazy days, which went past you like a wind?

    If not, now is your moment!
