## Check-in 📌

To start off, if you guys are looking for a book  to read, try out **"The War of Art"** by *Steven Pressfield*. I haven't got done with the book yet, but I already love it! 🙌

I found it a little difficult to plan the day with Ramadan here. So, I thought to try out a new schedule from tomorrow (*Thank you Inas*), which could help me find time to study and prep for the coming *Test-2*. Nevertheless, I feel that I *did* spend my day productively, by using my time well as well as by getting enough sleep. But I guess I could do better. 💡

*Also*, the fact that every faculty is asking for a *reason* to attend the exams online is getting a little annoying now. *Uhm, I don't the pandemic?¿* 👀

I really *want* to attend the exams offline, but only once the situation gets better and when a considerable amount of students attends it offline. (*I might be contradicting myself, but this is what I feel*)

(*Also, I'll try to follow this format for a daiy blog and post a blog on a topic once or twice a week. This would allow me to write good content, as well as get me time to work and study*)
