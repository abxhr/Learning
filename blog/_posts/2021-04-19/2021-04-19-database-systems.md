## Check-In 📌

Okay, before I talk about how the paper went, I got no proper sleep today. I probably got like 5 hours of sleep altogether today (*altogether as in, 3 hours of sleep last night and 2 hours of sleep after the exam*).

Database Systems Paper went *Decent* I guess, although I think I could've done better. (*Message for myself: Its okay, let's ace the compres!*)

I have *two* exams tomorrow: **Data Structures and Algorithms** and **Microproccesors and Interfacing**

Oh! If you guys need help learning DSA, check out this YouTube [Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw) by this amazing man named Abdul Bari (*God bless him!*). 

Alright. Let me get back to studying for tomorrow (*I might end up staying late today also. So RIP Sleep*)

## Highlights of the Day ✨
- Wrote my *Database Systems* Test - 2 ✍️
- Studied (*more like studying*) *Data Structures and Algorithms* and *Microproccesors and Interfacing* 📚
- **Ramadan Day 7** ❤️

## Goals for tomorrow 📝
