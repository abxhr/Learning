I had to take a break from writing this *amazing* blog, due to the *hectic* work from everywhere. 

Besides that, I have **huge** plans coming up, *InShaAllah*. I'll try to put up more about it here. *So expect that soon!*

To catch you up, I got down with my Second Year (**yay!**), and I have my <strong><em>Summer Internship</em></strong> at *Emirates* going on right now. I'm currently working with the *Revenue Optimisation* Division at Emirates. Besides that, my daily-schedule was pretty messed up from the last semester, and I'm still trying to fix it and get good sleep. 

I have a *bunch of thoughts* in my head, which I want to soon share with you all, through this blog and *other* platforms (👀)
