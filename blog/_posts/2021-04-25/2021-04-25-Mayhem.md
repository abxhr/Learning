## Check-in 📌

Okay I have to say, the amount assignments and deadlines are just overwhelming now. There just alot to do. 

The semester goes all fine till the first assessment (*Test - 1*) starts. After that, its just work on top of work. 

Personally, I don't like submitting an assignment or a project, without putting in enough efforts for me. But then, when you have multiple assignments, with deadlines so close to each other, there tend to lose quality on each of these assignments, which I don't like.

That being said, let me continue writing my report! :)
