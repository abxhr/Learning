## Territory üö©

I got done reading the book **The War of Art** today (*definitely a good read)*, and I really loved one of the last chapters called "*The Territorial Orientation*", where *he* speaks about having personal territories.

A personal territory could be pretty much summed up through the following words:
<p align="center">
  <em>"There's a three-legged coyote who lives up the hill from me. All the garbage cans in the neighborhood belong to him. It's his territory"</em>
</p>

Just like how the coyote has a territory, each one of us would have our own territory. For *Mark Zuckerberg*, it was his dorm room. For *Elon Musk*, it is one of the Tesla Factories. (*For me, it is the desk I have home*)  

One key point to remember (*among the other points he mentioned in the book*), is that a *territory* isn't just a place that you "*work*" or spend your time at. <em><strong>A territory can only be claimed by work</strong></em>. To *earn* your territory, you should put in your efforts to do so. *"A territory doesn't give, it gives back".* *Cristiano Ronaldo* didn't earn the football pitch as his territory in one night. 

These are the other *qualities* of a territory (*as mentioned by the author*):
* <em><strong>A territory provides sustenance</strong></em>: A territory in itself doesn't bring you down, or burn you out. *"A runner would know what a territory is"*  
* <em><strong>A territory sustains us withought any external input</strong></em>: A territory doesn't require you to *nurture* it, it requires you to put in *effort and love*; "*the territory absorbs this and gives it back to us in the form of well-being*"
* <em><strong>A territory returns exactly what you put in</strong></em>: They are fair. "*What you deposited, you get back, dollar-for-dollar*"

    Do you have a territory too?
    <br>
    If so, "What's your territory?"
