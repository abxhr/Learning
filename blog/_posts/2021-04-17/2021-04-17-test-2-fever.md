## Check-In 📌

I focussed on studying *Math - III* and on solving related problems today (*Obviously, cause I have my Test - 2 starting tomorrow*). 😤

I feel like I can't balance my sleep that well now, as my schedule has gone berserk since Ramadan started. So I'll have to work on that so I could find more time to study and work on my stuff. ⏳

Also, I found this really interesting [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) today, where you are required to find the number of "Islands" from a given 2-D Grid. I tried to use Backtracking along with Depth-First Search Algorithm to solve the question in *O(nm)* time complexity, but I think it could be solved faster (*I'll have to think how though*). You could find the code I wrote [here](https://github.com/abxhr/Coding-Problems/blob/main/LeetCode/codes/200.py). 

Let me know in the comments if you have a better solution. 🤗

## Highlights of the Day ✨
- Studied *Math - III* 📚
- Continued Reading [The Sealed Nectar](https://darussalamstore.com/en/the-sealed-nectar-ar-raheeq-al-makhtoum-14x21.html) 💛
- **Ramadan Day 5** ❤️

## Goals for tomorrow 📝

## Side Note 💭
If you guys have suggestions for the stuff that I should try to mention in the *daily-blog* template, let me know through the comments below, or just send me a message [here](https://abxhr-learning.vercel.app/about/).
