## Competition üèÉ

I personally view "*competition*" to be a *good thing* (*and necessary*). What I mean by competition is basically having (*or exposing yourself to*) an environment, where other people too in that environment strive on a goal that you might have. 

Why I personally view *competition* to be necessary is because in your path to your career/education goals, you might lose track of current situation of that goal you want to achieve. It could mean in terms of skills required to achieve it, tools required to work for it and so on. When a person faces this dilemma, without an environment with people who might share common goals, he/she might lose the motivation that they once had, when they started off on this journey.

I also prefer myself to be exposed to an environment where I could get competition for the goal I might have, as this would even help put in much more better work into striving to achieve that goal. As students, this might even be quite evident to us through the work we put in due to the environment we might exposed to among our friends, peers, and at the university/school. 

One key point while being in such an environment, is to also **not to over-work yourself due to the competition**. Even though competition pushes us to put in more (*better*) work, it is also essential to have *fun* while working towards your goal. Always remember that you chose that goal of your's because you are passionate about it, and also cause it brings you joy. And if you are not having fun, there is probably something wrong, which should be dubugged ASAP! ü§ñ

Although having *competition* could help you in alot of ways, it could harm you too if taken too seriously. Some might even jump over the very fine line between "*competition*" and "*comparison*", and *comparison* is in no way healthy for you.
