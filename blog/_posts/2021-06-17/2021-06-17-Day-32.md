## Work! üíØ

One aspect that could be clearly seen between a *pro* and an *amateur* is that the *pro* always gets up and *works* towards her goals, no matter what obstacle comes towards her. 

"*Work*" is an integral part to achieve success; be it in Computer Science, Business, Writing, or whatever career choices there might be.

By *work*, I don't mean the 9 - 5 jobs specifically. It could be you getting up to sit on your workspace to continue working towards your dreams, goals and/or aspirations. That is *work*. Waking up early, to catch that metro, to meet and interact with people, to pitch that amazing idea, to understand your flaws, to work on fixing those flaws, to coming back home, and getting that good sleep, that, is *work*.

Being a student, we are at that point in life, where the work and efforts we put in now, are the key points to how our careers turn out to be, later in our lives. Be it learning those skills you always wanted to learn, writing that innovative research paper, working on that creative project of your's, **now is the time**. 

*Time*; don't waste it. If you already did spend alot of your time not working for your goals, don't spend your time now regretting it either, but rather get to work.

Don't be that guy who has amazing goals set out for themselves, but prefers to scroll through Instagram Feed rather than working towards achieving those goals.

You have the ability to decide what you do, what you want do, why you want to do it, and when you want to do it. The sooner you realise this, the sooner you start working.
