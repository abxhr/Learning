## Check-in 📌

As I ended up sleeping late due to the work I had to do, I ended up missing today's first lecture. So, note to myself: **FIX YOUR SLEEP!** 💤

Despite that, my day was *productive*. My group and I discussed for our assingments which are due soon. And we did a good amount of work (*while having fun at the same time*).

Also, is it just me or do you always have plenty of recipe videos pop up everytime you open Youtube when you are fasting? 👀

## Highlights of the Day ✨

- Discussed for Database Systems Assignment 🗄
