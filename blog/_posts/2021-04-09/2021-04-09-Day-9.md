## Why did I become a morning-person? 🌤

I used to always be a night-person. I used to be at the peak of my energy by 9 PM and I start my work properly then. Due to that, I would always end up sleeping late and getting up late. And repeat the next day. 🌑

To be honest, I felt like that was the best schedule to have because it used to be really comfortable for me. Until I tried being a morning-person. ☀️

About a little more than 8 months back, I started noticing that although I would be at the peak of my energy by 9 PM, that didn't last so long, and that the next day just goes on too sloppy until 9 PM hits again. So I thought to try out something new which could help me put in more focused work (and also get better sleep). So I tried being a *morning-person*.

**It was hard. Really hard.** I found it really difficult; difficult to sleep early, difficult to get up early, difficult to start work early, and so on. 😣

But then I tried to stay committed. Although I found it really difficult, I kept doing it anyway. I stayed consistent with sleeping earlier and getting up early. 

**And it worked!**. Trust me, it actually did. And I absolutely loved it! I found so much more time in a day to work on the stuff that is important to me. I was more focused on my work. I loved getting up early, praying, and then getting that amazing cup of coffee. It is also one of the reasons why I get better (*and longer*) sleep now. 😎

Don't get me wrong tho. I'm still not *perfect* in getting up at the same time and always maintaining it. And I still do struggle a little to get up on time, but its so much than it used to be.

This would probably go on till 6 AM so that I make sure I get up. (*I'm just exposing myself here* 👀)

## Advice 💡

For a month, or a week, or atleast a day, try being a *morning-person*. And try to see how different it is from being a *night-person* and how much more time you could get in a day.

(**Disclaimer**: *Being a morning-person is not for everyone. Maybe you do better and focus better being a night-person. But give both the routines a try before you decide on following one*)
