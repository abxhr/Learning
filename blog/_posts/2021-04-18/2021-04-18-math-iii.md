## Check-In 📌

<p align="center">
  <em>Test - 2 started today!</em> 
</p>

To be honest, the *Math - III* paper went better than I expected. (*I mean I did stay up till 2:00 AM studying so nvm*)

Oh. The paper had this question where we had to use Laplace Transformation to solve the differential equation. Although I did practice alot, this question was different. I didn't know what to do after reaching a point while writing the answer, substituting the value for y'(0). So I guess I'm losing my marks there (*besides the other marks also that I will be losing*) :)))

(*Let me know if you have the complete solution for it!*)

Good thing that the exam was by 1:30 PM, which allowed me to get a little sleep. (*That won't be the case tomorrow though.*) 

Anyway, I'll have to get back to studying Database Systems now, so bye bye!
