Another challenge, LETSGOO!

This time I shall try to finish it completely (not throwing shade at all at myself)

## Why did I take this challenge? ðŸ¤”

To be honest, the straight answer is that I don't want to waste my time, being lazy. I just got done with an amazing 2-month internship, and I still have almost a month to go until university opens again. And I want to make sure that I spend my time well in these days (and after also).

## What is Flutter anyway?

It's basically a tool that allows you to build native cross-platform apps by using just one codebase (and one programming language - [*Dart*](https://dart.dev/).

The whole idea behind flutter that makes it easy to develop apps is that it uses "*UI as Code*" - you keep building onto a *Widget Tree*, for any component you will be placing into the application. That means that everything that is there in a Flutter Application is a *Widget*.
