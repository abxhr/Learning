So, I fell a little sick today. And, so I won't be writing the blog I usually write.

But I'm glad that you came here! So I'm not let you go away with nothing. 

I read this poem recently, and I was reflecting over it for quite some time. I'm sure you'll love it too.

  <em>
    <strong>If</strong><br>
    - by Rudyard Kipling<br><br>
    If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
    But make allowance for their doubting too;<br
    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
    Or being lied about, don‚Äôt deal in lies,<br>
    Or being hated, don‚Äôt give way to hating,<br>
    And yet don‚Äôt look too good, nor talk too wise:<br><br>
    If you can dream‚Äîand not make dreams your master;<br>
    If you can think‚Äîand not make thoughts your aim;<br>
    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
    And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
    If you can bear to hear the truth you‚Äôve spoken<br>
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
    And stoop and build ‚Äôem up with worn-out tools:<br><br>
    If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
    And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
    And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
    And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
    Except the Will which says to them: ‚ÄòHold on!‚Äô<br><br>
    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
    Or walk with Kings‚Äînor lose the common touch,<br>
    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
    If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
    If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
    With sixty seconds‚Äô worth of distance run,<br>
    Yours is the Earth and everything that‚Äôs in it,<br>
    And‚Äîwhich is more‚Äîyou‚Äôll be a Man, my son! <br>
  </em>
