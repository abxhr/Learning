## Journaling üìî

This was something that I started to do that, not that long back. Although I was pretty not-down with the whole idea of physically writing stuff down on a book, journaling is something that I'm glad I started doing.

Journaling could be writing about your day, planning out your day (*week, month or year*), writing about your thoughts and ideas and so on. It's not necessary that it should be a daily-thing as well. You could do it on the weekends, or whenever you could take a moment to just sit down.

Personally, I use my journal to plan out my day (*and week*), jot down the amazing ideas I have, and sometimes write down about how the day went. 

After I started journaling, I noticed a huge impact on the work I did. I was much more focused and concentrated on the tasks I wanted to do, as I very well knew how I wanted to spend my day; working towards my daily goals.

We surround ourselves around so many devices and we run around our busy lives, that we also sometimes forget how powerful and impactful taking a moment off from our busy bandwagon to sit down and write down our thoughts and ideas would be.
