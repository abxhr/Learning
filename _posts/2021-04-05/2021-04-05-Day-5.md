## Procrastination 🤒

Ugh. This is something that I hate the most, cause I often fall trapped into it. Be it if I'm starting a new project, learning a new skill, reading a book, or even cleaning my workspace. Over the years, I've had so many instances which has made me much more resistant to it, but I'm not immune to it. Most of us could even procrastinate dealing with our problem of procrastinating thinking about our procrastinaiton problem. 😸

[Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg) in a recent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP0oVOH4Zz4&t=306s) said that if we were to get started or continue on some goal and you feel a resistance which tries to stop you from doing it, the more resistance you feel, the more important that goal or project is to you.

Often it is also the *thought* of the end-goal, how you might fail, *"what will others think"?*, *"Am I even ready for this?"*, or even those infinite distractions that stop you from doing your task to build your enterprise or your project.

### *My tip?* 🤗

- **Push yourself into doing it!**: Realise that you had the *thought* of choosing that particular *goal* for a reason; to improve and help *you*. 

- **Get rid of the distractions**: It's always *that* instagram notification or that cringy video in TikTok that stops you again when you finally decide to do it.

- **Find peers who understands your goals**: At the end, if you have amazing peers who could be having the same goals as you, motivate you, or could even share the same difficulties as you, you'd most likely push yourself too!. 

- **Take breaks**: When you start of with your work, don't burn-out yourself by working excessively. Take a few breaks now and then, and energize yourself to continue with your work. (*Make sure that you don't get pulled in by those notifications tho*)

- **Schedule your work**: Scheduling your work prior to it, really helps you to understand how you could use your time in the right way. (*Check out the previous [blog](https://abxhr-learning.vercel.app/Day-4/) for more on this!*) 

### Final takeaways! 🕸

We can't always be blaming the situations (*like this pandemic*) for not doing work. At the end of the day, you really have to put in your effort to achieve your goals. Remember that later, we can't blame *time* for not allowing us to work on our project/enterprise/idea/or whatever it is.
