## Perfectionism 💡

</p>

The one reason I'm writing this blog is that I've seen this aspect to be present in alot of people when they try to start off a new journey; be it learning a new skill, starting a project, or even making a cup of coffee. ☕️

The idea of being "*perfect*" might be the reason why you aren't able to push yourself into building a skill, starting a new project, or even make a decent cup of coffee.

There is one thing that I've learned from the past few years; **you really don't have to be perfect at something before you try something in it.** Be it learning to code in a new language, or trying to learn a new concept, you don't have to be perfect before you start working on a project with that particular language or concept. 

Be it if you know a little about what you are going to do, or not, you **will** eventually stumble upon various challenges that would require you to be proactive again (*like you did when you first started off*), to solve those challenges, so that you could move on to find the next challenge that would come towards you. 

It is always good to aim for perfection while doing any task or when striving towards your goal. But that shouldn't be the same reason that stops you from doing that particular task or to attain that particular goal. 

Think for a moment, *is this the reason that is stopping you from doing what you always wanted to do?* 🤔

It is like how the quote goes, "<strong><em>Aim for the moon, and if you miss, you'll land among the stars</em></strong>" (*although I find this quote astronomically incorrect*).
