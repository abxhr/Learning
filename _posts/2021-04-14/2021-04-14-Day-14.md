## Check-in 📌

I had quite a busy day; I focussed on studying Microprocessors and Interfacing today. To be honest, the subject is really interesting. It really gives you brief dive into what actually happens in most of our devices. 

Speaking about devices, my PC is really annoying sometimes. It has decent specs and works like a breeze *usually*. But when I have something to do urgently (*like submit my journal or continue my GitHub Streak*), then it just stops working. Like it almost knows that I have to do somwthing and it goes like "**HAHA abshar. Nope**". 👀

Also, I have my first meeting with the GitHub Campus Experts tomorrow! So I'm quite excited for that. Looking forward to it! 🤩
