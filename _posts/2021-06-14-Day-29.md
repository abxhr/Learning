One problem that students these days face (*including me*), is that we tend to get so caught up in how doing something *could* be really difficult or that we fear that we know *too less* to actually do that *something*, that we end up not doing that *something* itself. 

But in reality, that fear itself should be telling you that, that *something* means alot to you, and doing that *something* would make you happy. I guess Computer Science students would be able to relate more closely with this dilemma, we usually get so caught up in fear that we might not be able to implement or work with a particular field, framework, language, etc.

To quote this book I read recently (*The War of Art*), the author (*Steven Pressfield*) says:
<p align='center'>
  <em>Resistance is directly proportional to love. If you're feeling massive Resistance, the good news id, it means there's tremendous love there too. If you didn't love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn't feel anything. The opposite of love isn't hate; it's indifference.</em>
</p>

I had to go out my way too, today, to do few of the stuff that I did today. Although, in the beginning it might seem so taunting, once you actually *do it*, the joy you get out of it is something which is so delightful.

    <em>Let me know of some instance that you have been through too, where you had to fight off the Resistance, to do something cool!</em>

## Highlights of the Day ‚ú®
- Completed the real-time problem, based on Airline Legs and Segments, using PostgreSQL
- Worked with Airport APIs to fetch data on Airport Location Data
- Started working on this really cool tool I found, [GCMap](https://github.com/paulgb/gcmap), which would help me plot Airline paths geographically
- Worked with plot.ly to help me plot the coordinates easily

## Goals for tomorrow üìù
- Try to implement the solutions for the Airline Problem, through a Front-End Application, using Python Frameworks (*maybe Dash framework?*)
- Schedule meets in [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) for the week
- Work on *existing* Personal Open Source Projects
- Reach out to community leaders in Dubai, for collaborations
- Plan out the weekend
