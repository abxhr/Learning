## Why do I love fridays? 🌙

Friday is that day of the week for me where I energize and find peace for the coming week. I usually do this by cleaning out my workspace, spending time with my family, and even planning out my next week.

Spending a day with myself and looking back at the week I had really gets me going and also to do better the coming week.

**Fact**: Starting a blog (_like this one_) was something I thought of on a friday, probably a year back, when this pandemic started. So lets hope that I keep this going! 💯

(*PS: I added a comment section to the posts now, so you could let me know what your beautiful mind thinks!*)
