   <em>My so-called wanderer friend</em>

I feel a little better from yesterday, but I'm still really tired and exhausted. 

This blog is going to be short too :(

The poem is one of my poems of all time; **Do not go gentle into that good night** - *by Dylan Thomas* (*You might be familiar with this poem from the movie Interstellar*)

  <em>
    <strong>If</strong><br>
    - by Rudyard Kipling<br><br>
    If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
    But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
    Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:<br><br>
    If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
    And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
    If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:<br><br>
    If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
    And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
    And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
    And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’<br><br>
    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
    If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
    If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>
    Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son! <br>
