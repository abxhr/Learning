## How often should we have fun? ⛄️

### Short answer: 

*EVERYDAY*. 

### Long answer: 

Each day when we wake up, we always try to think forward towards what we want to achieve in that day and what we could do to complete those infinite to-do lists. But do we look forward to actually having "fun" that day?

Now, please don't mistake "*fun*" here as binging on "*The Office*" or scrolling through Instagram. But like *fun-fun*. 

"*Fun*" could be spending lots of quality time with your friends and family, working on that really cool project of your's, or even just taking a moment to be grateful for those amazing things that you have achieved today, this week, or even those atheletic competitions you had when you were in Grade - 1. 💯 

(*or also planning to go to the Expo site with your friends by 5 PM, but end up reaching there by 5:45 PM, and also starve for some food and end up finally eating in the car*)

(*PS: Thank you Inas for schooling me on Human Biology*)

### Tip? 🤗

Before you start your day, take moment to plan out some "*fun*" stuff you could do on that day. And try to look back at if those "*fun*" stuff actually made your day better and made you ready to face your next challenge.
