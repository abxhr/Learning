I had my first "**Meet & Greet**" for the *GitHub Campus Experts Program* today. And I really have to say, it was *wonderful*! 💛

At the start of the event, it was just "*Hey!*"s and "*Hello!*"s through the chat box. But as the event took off in this amazing platform called [IceBreakers](https://icebreaker.video/), we were soon able to see and speak with a few new Campus Experts. I spoke and got to know 4 new Campus Experts. They were amazing people from across the globe, doing plenty of inspiring and amazing work to build and help the community. 🙌

The event (*and the program*) is handled by the amazing [Juan](https://github.com/juanpflores) from GitHub. He gave us a brief walkthrough through our training and journey to become a Campus Expert, and I should say it sounded exciting! (*He introduced us to his cute pet too*) 

This interaction between the Campus Experts gave us a headstart to the program. (*Ahm! We were hinted about the swag we will get too*) 🤞

I'm really looking forward to working and interacting more with GitHub and the Campus Experts soon, to help build our communities! ⚡️
