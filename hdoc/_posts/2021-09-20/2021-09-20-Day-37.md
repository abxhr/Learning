## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

I spent some time learning and coding JavaScript (*specifically Object Oriented Programming Concepts in JS*)

Besides that, I also spent some time with three Pull Requests I had created, as te reviewer requested few changes to made. (*I also got two of my pull requests for a repository in Microsoft merged! Although the changes that were made were small, it still feels good to have contributed.*)

I also spent some time getting familiar with GitHub Actions, as I've done earlier. The more time I spend with it, the more I realise how powerful it is!.

(*I also got a mail from AngelHack, accepting me into their Student Ambassador Program!*)

That is pretty much it from **Day 37**! üöÄ
