## What did I do today? ⚡️

I mainly worked on learning more about GitHub Actions today. I'm currently focusing on this, because I want to learn more about how to work with CI/CD tools, so that I could use for deployment later.

Once I'm familiar with GitHub Actions, I'll try to take a look at other CI/CD tools as well, such as Jenkins and Travis.

Besides that, I wasn't able to work on much, as I had quite a busy day at university too!
