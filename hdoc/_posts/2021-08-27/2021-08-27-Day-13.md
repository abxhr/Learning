## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

So, as you might know from if you have read the blod from the previous friday, friday is usually my *chill* day.

I started my day with a bit of JavaScript practice and *ES6*. Is it just me, or does ES6 JS feel like completely different language itself? :)

Then I spent some time on my application for the Microsfot Learn Student Ambassador Program. I'll try submitting my application by tomorrow itself, *InShaAllah*.

After that, it was just lots of *family* time. (*Also, if you are looking for a good family movie, watch this beautiful Turkish movie called "Miracle in Cell No. 7". Don't @ me if you end up crying*)

Later, I spent some time reading the Flutter Docs, and also trying out few of their widgets, to get started.

That's it for Day #13! üöÄ
