## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

I spent some time around Open Source today!

I looked out for issues to solve on GitHub. I came across a few issues, which are quite easy to solve. Ended up creating 3 pull requests for Microsoft, Facebook, and GitHub.

The PR for Microsoft and Facebook got merged! 

Also, CodeLand started today! It was fun attending it. Amazing talks from some amazing people. I mainly loved this talk on "Imposter Syndrome" in Developers, as it was totally relatable, and something I face very often.

That was pretty much it for **Day 40**! üöÄ
