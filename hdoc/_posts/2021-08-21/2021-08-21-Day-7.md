## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

WWOHOO! Day 7! It's been a week already.

To be honest, today was quite a busy day (*after an amazing chill day*), as I had my driving lesson, club meeting, and I was out with friends till midnight üò¨

I started my day by working on my JavaScript Repo, where I try to revise, learn, and take down notes for the concepts I'll be going through. 

Later, I had a nice chat with one of my friends, where I had to walk him through the basics of *Git & GitHub*, and how to get started with it. I knew nothing about *Git & GitHub*, until the end of last year. But now, I use it almost everyday! 

After that, I had to review two pull requests, for which I had been assigned as a reviewer. (*It's my first time reviewing a PR in GitHub! Although it was just text in markdown, I guess it's a start.*)

I also worked on building a Discord Bot, for a Discord server that I'm trying to create. Discord Server is soon meant to accomodate a community within the university. Let me know if you are familiar with good bots, which I could use for moderation, automation, etc.

That's day 7!
