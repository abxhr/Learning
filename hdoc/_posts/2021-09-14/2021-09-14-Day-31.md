## What did I do today? ⚡️

I had my driving lessons today, after my classes at my university. Amd I ended up reaching back home by around 7:30 PM. And I was dead tired. I had a small meal, prayed, and jumped right onto my bed.

So, basically, I wasn't able to code today (*besides my university stuff obviously*). This tiring schedule will go on for tomorrow too.
