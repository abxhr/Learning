## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

Let me start off with this: I have to figure out some way to not die tired, when I get back home from university. I guess it's cause of all the online classes for quite some time now :))

The courses are quite interesting this semester though. The core courses for this semester are Operating Systems, Theory of Computation, Principles of Programming Language, and Computer Architecture. I also took up Data Mining as my elective this semester, along with a Project Course on Computer Vision. (*I also took up Philosophy as my Humanities elective*)

After I got back home, I worked on revising and getting familiar with the Azure Cloud Platform. I'll be trying to focus on getting familiar with Cloud Platforms. It's been long overdue that I get familiar with CI/CD. 

That was pretty much it for **Day 24**! üöÄ
