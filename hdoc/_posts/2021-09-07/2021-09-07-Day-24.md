## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

Today was the Day #1 for my Third Year at University! TBH, it was great to just go back to uni. I did kinda miss it.

As University is now open, and I'll be attending all my classes offline itself, I find time to work on other stuff, once I get back home by around 5:00 PM. I'm trying to figure out a way to schedule my time so that I could work and dedicate my time for other stuff too.

I worked on the Machine Learning Course that I was doing, and I managed to complete it today. I thought to focus on working on this, as I was browsing for projects I could perhaps work on, for the Data Mining course I have taken this semester.

I also spent a little more time on a bit of CSS, as I still need to get a hang of the grid layouts (*including flexbox*).

And that was pretty much it for **Day 23**! üöÄ
