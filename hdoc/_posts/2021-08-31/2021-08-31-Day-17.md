## What did I do today? ⚡️

I started my day by practicing a bit of JavaScript (*No new concepts. Just trying out the stuff I already learned*)

Then I worked a bit on the Discord Bot. I had a good conversation with the team about the same, and they had many amazing suggestions, to make the bot work. (*Will try getting an initial prototype of the bot soon!*)

Later, I went out to meet the boys 

After I got back home, I spent some more time working with and experimenting many widgets of Flutter. It's interesting to try out even one widget, with the various arguments that it provides.
