## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

So my university had its first event after so so long today; icebreakers. TBH, it was fun. I ended up reaching home by around 10 PM ‚ò†

So autommatically, I wasn't able to spend so much time coding today.

I did spend some time reading more about "*Game AI and Deep Reinforcement Learning*". The idea behind it is pretty cool: you create a model for the machine to learn how to play a game. It basically works on "*reward system*" basis, where a good decision made is "*reinforced*" by "*rewarding*" the model.

That was pretty much it for **Day 38**! üöÄ
