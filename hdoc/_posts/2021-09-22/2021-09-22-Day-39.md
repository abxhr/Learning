## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

I had quite some work at university, which made me a bit occupied, after getting back home as well.

I did spend some time on doing a code review on GitHub, for one of the sessions for the Coding Bootcamp. That did take some time, as there were alot of content to go through.

After that, I spent some time going through the docs of TensorFlow, for my project. I'll be looking into how Deep Learning could be implemented, which is often used with Computer Vision.

That was pretty it for **Day 39**! üöÄ
