## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

I had applied for the position of a Teaching Assitant for C Programming Lab for this semester. Apparently, as many applied for the same, the Instructor In-Charge asked the applicants to attend a "test" to choose the TA for the lab. So, as it has been quite some time since I last wrote code in C, I tried to spend some with C again.

Later in the evening, my club, *ACM* had our first event for this year. A talk, by Shreya Jain, an Alum from my university, who is now a Machine Learning Engineer at Apple. It was a great session where students got the chance to ask her questions all the way from applying for Masters, to getting that dream job.

I also spent some time working on making the requested changes for one of the PR that I created yesterday.

That is pretty much it for **Day 36!** üöÄ
