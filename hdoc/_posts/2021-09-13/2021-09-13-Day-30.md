## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

I guess I didn't do much today as I had quite alot to do at uni.

I spent some time in the morning working on JavaScript (*Yep, I'm still doing Regex*). I did alot of Regex with Python, but yeah I want to make sure I'm familiar with it in JavaScript. 

I also went through a paper, for learning and getting more insight on the topic for my project this semester. 

That is pretty much it for **Day 30!** üöÄ

(*I also finally applied for the teaching assistant position at my University!*)

(*Also. It's been a month since I started this challenge! So let me take a moment to congratulate myself for staying focused, rather than spending my time procrastinating*)
