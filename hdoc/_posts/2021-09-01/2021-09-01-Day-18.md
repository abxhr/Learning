## What did I do today? ⚡️

So I thought to dedicate most of my day today in learning and working along with Flutter. I want to make sure that I get a hang of it soon, so that I could then experiment it by creating projects. I took a very planned approach today, in learning Flutter, than the very hit-and-trail method way I did earlier, by going through step by step, through processes involved in building a Flutter app (*or native apps*).
