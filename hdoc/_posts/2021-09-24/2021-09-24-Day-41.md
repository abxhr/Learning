## What did I do today? ⚡️

As you might know, *Friday* is my *chill day*. So, I didn't do much today.

I did create a Pull Request for Google. But I ended up realising that that particular prject was no longer being maintained. So I felt sad 😩

Today was the day 2 for *CodeLand*. I attended the talks for today as well. TBH, *CodeLand* is one of the best conference/event that I have attended in quite some time. Loved it! 💖

That is pretty much it for my chill day, **Day 41**! 🚀
