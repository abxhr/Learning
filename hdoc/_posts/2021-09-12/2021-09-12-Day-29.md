## What did I do today? ⚡️

Ah! How I wish it was still the weekend 😩

I started my day by reading through a research paper, for the research paper I'll soon be working on. I also searched up on more math involved with the research paper.

After I came back home, I spent some time working on my CSS skills, as I still need to master it. Revised on a bit of topics such as Media Queries, Gradients, and positioning.

I also spent some time working on my Portfolio Website. It has the basic HTML template ready. Now I'll have to focus on styling it and making it more dynamic.

That's it for **Day 29**! 🚀

(*Also, I guess managed my time better today. I found more time to do the stuff I want, at the same time doing the essential chores that I had to do.*)
