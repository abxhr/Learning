## What did I do today? ⚡️

I spent some time doing a course on Deep Learning (*in Kaggle*), to get familiar with the concept for using it in my upcoming project.

I also started working on this issue I found on GitHub today, for *Jenkins*, which is a CI/CD platform. I'll try to create the pull request for it by tomorrow, or the day after.

I also found an issue for *ESRI*, which I think is pretty easy to work on. So I might try to work on that as well.

There was a live session by *Appwrite* today, for the upcoming *Hacktober*. The session was called "*Intro to Open Source*", and it had Juan Pa from GitHub, Swift from MLH, Jen from Microsoft, and Aditya from Appwrite/MLH. It was great to listen in to the amazing conversation on everything open source to even building amazing communities through them.
