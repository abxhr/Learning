## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

As you might know, Fridays are my *chill* day. So, I ended up not doing so much.

I spent some time working along with Flask Framework (*Python*) again, as it has been quite some time since I last used it. I like how Flask is simple and lightweight, yet very powerful at the same time.

I also spent some time working on learning to use CockroachDB for the first time. CockroachDB is basically an SQL Database (*which is also PostgreSQL compaitable*), which allows you to easily deploy databases. It's quite easy to integrate it with Python too.

That was pretty much all that I did today! üëÄüöÄ

(*OHH ALSO! I finished playing Hitman 3 today! I have to say, it's an amaazing game. You should definitely try it out!*)
