## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

It was a really tiring day at uni. Ended up dozing off, after I came back home. 

I got up, and started studying for my tests that is coming this week. I went through a bit of *Theory of Computation* and *Operating Systems*.

After that, I started working through an issue I found in *JenkinsCI*'s  repository.

I found another issue in "*NetworkX*" repo (*A math based library*), to make their docs a bit better for the explanation of one of their classes. So I'll try to start working on it soon as well.

Later, I spent some time learning *Deep Learning*. Created few dense neural networks, to solve a few problems on Kaggle. (*It's reaaally interesting. Crazy how much math could do*)

I also started working on this new project, which will try to make the use of *automatons* easier, with python. Maybe like a python library that could create automatons, check inputs, etc.

That's pretty much it for **Day 43**! üöÄ
