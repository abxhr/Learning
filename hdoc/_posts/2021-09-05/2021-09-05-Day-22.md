## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

Summary: I didn't do much today.

Today was the *Registration Day* for this semester. Went back to uni after quite a long time. It was fun, but reaaaaally tiring.

Once I got back home by around 5:00 PM, I was dead tired, and I literally dozed off. I got up by the time of *Maghrib* prayer, and still felt so tired.

I worked a bit on Flutter though, after I had good cup of tea. And then I tried to practice a little of JavaScript too.

Later, after dinner, I spent some time on the Discord Bot, and figuring out a very small bug.

That was pretty much it for **Day 22**! üöÄ
