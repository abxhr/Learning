## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

So I got up late today (*More like I slept alot more today, cus uni opens up soon*).

I spent some time working on my JavaScript. I'll try to cover Regex tomorrow. I'll also try to go through few Data Structures that JavaScript provides.

Besides that, I spent some time on CSS. I tried to go through few concepts related to Positioning the elements properly, through Flexbox and Grid Layout. 

I also worked on learning the Flutter Framework. I found this pretty good playlist (*atlast*), where he explains the concepts used in Flutter. ([YouTube - Flutter in Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbUey9oquuU&list=PLhXZp00uXBk5TSY6YOdmpzp1yG3QbFvrN&index=1))

I spent some time browsing through and finding resources for Computer Vision. I tried to use the "[*awesome-computer-vision*](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision)" repo in GitHub, but I didn't find any well-documented playlist or courses there. I did find good content on Computer Vision, on YouTube, by Stanford and Udacity, so I might try using those itself. (*Let me know if you have any other resources*)

That's it for **Day 16**! üöÄ
