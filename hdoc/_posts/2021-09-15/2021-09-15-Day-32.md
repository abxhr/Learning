## What did I do today? ⚡️

I had my driving classes today as well. So I was dead tired again, when I reached home by around 7:30 PM.

I thought to spend some time to code either way, as I think I haven't spent much time coding this week.

I tried to focus on getting familiar with GitHub Actions (*CI/CD* stuff). Learnt the basics, and tried out setting up a workflow with the blog! So now, everytime a new blog is up in this website, my GitHub Profiles README file updates itself, to add the blog link to it.

That is pretty much it for **Day 32**!

(*Although this doesn't count, I tried setting up a broadcast channel with StreamYard for YouTube, Facebook and Twitch, for something that is coming up!*)
