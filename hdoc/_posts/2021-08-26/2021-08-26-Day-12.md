## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

So, today wasn't the best day. First of all I got up late, and I also had to clean my room (*and my house*).

In the morning, I spent some time getting familiar with ES6 JavaScript (*As I was doing ES5 in the beginning*). I tried solving a few coding problems using JavaScript, to help me grasp the language a little more better.

Later, I worked on my application for the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Program. I'll try to get done with application by tomorrow or the day after, as the application deadline is by the end of this month. 

I also spent some time working on Flutter, by going through some of its documentation (*reading documentation could help you grasp a language/library/framework much better, as they explain each of the functionalities of that particular thing.*)

I also got teamed up for the Hackathon that is coming up soon! There is a hackathon that I have registered for this week (*Shark Hacks by MLH*), but I guess I might just attend the workshops for it.

That's it for Day 12! üöÄ
