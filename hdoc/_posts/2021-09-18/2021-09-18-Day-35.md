## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

So my morning today didn't go the best, due to driving stuff :(

Later, I had "*GitHub Field Day: India*" event to attend! and it was just amazing! üíú
Although I wasn't able to attend the full event, I still got to interact with alot of tech community leaders from India through the event, and also get alot of insight of handling communities, through them. I think I might get some swag stuff too, but they'll deliver it only to India.

Then, I worked on some Open-Source stuff. I came across these two two repositories to make contributions for; one of which was a repository of Microsoft. I ended up making two pull requests by the end of the day!

Hacktober Fest is coming up anyway! So I'm planning to spend more time contributing to repositories through the event.

That's it for **Day 35**! üöÄ
