## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

Today seemed like a normal day (*better than the past 4 days*).

I mainly spent my time today (*after coming back from university*) on doing a bit of research, on a lot of stuff:

1. I'll be working along with my boy, [Adnan](), on this Data Mining project for this semester. We were quite confused with what to be working on in the beginning, but we ended up choosing "*Game AI and Deep Reinforcement Learning*" as our project topic. Found some really cool resources (*mainly from [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai)*) for the same.

2. I'm also planning to work along with a senior from my university on this research paper on *Brownian Motion and Stochastic Equations*, where I'll be focusing on the programming part of the paper. So, I had to search up on few concepts, to get a better overview of the topic.

3. I also did a bit of research on Deep Learning Concepts, as I think I might need some of them for the Computer Vision Project I'm working on.

I also spent some time working on the Documentation for the Coding Bootcamp. I'll try to focus more on the bootcamp this week, so that I get finished up with it soon. I'll have to also plan how the sessions would be conducted, once the bootcamp starts.

That is pretty much it from **Day 26**! üöÄ
