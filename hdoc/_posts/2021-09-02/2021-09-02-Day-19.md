## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

So, as it was the last thursday before uni opened again, I tried to chill out a bit (*and watch this new show that I started watching called "Community")*. 

I did spend of time learning and coding with the Flutter Framework. I managed to get done with the Basic Quiz App that I was building. Building it really allowed me to jump into and browse through the source codes for various `Classes`, `Functions`, and `enums` which are very commonly used with Flutter. 

To keep going with flow, I spent some time practicing my JavaScript too. (*TBH, I'm really liking the feel of JavaScript, as compared to Python, which I use the most to code*)

I spent some time with the Machine Learning Course too, which I started, just to revise the concepts which I haven't used for some time now. 

Besides that, I spent some time updating my CV also, as I was browsing through Opportunities for the next Summer (2022).

That's it for **Day 19**! üöÄ
