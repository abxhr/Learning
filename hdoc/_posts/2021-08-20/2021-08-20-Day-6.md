## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

We are close to one week now! üöÄ

So, today was friday. And fridays are usually my *chill* day (*the day I rest*). So I didn't do *much*.

I started off my day with revising a little of Data Structures and Algorithms. Although I haven't concentrated on DSA through this challenge yet, I'll focus on that as well from now.

Besides that, I worked on my JavaScript revision. I don't know why, but I find JavaScript more amusing and fun, now that I'm doing it again after so long. As I've told before, I'll be updating a repo in my GitHub, with the notes I make while go through my JavaScript revision, so that I could use the same to teach others.

I also spent time on creating Coding Bootcamp for my club, *ACM*. Although I have planned out few resources to use to create the Bootcamp content, I'll have to search up and find few more to make the Bootcamp more fun and easy-to-understand.

Towards the end of the day, I spent a little time on solving coding problems on LeetCode; by resolving the past questions I have solved, and also solving one new problem.

That was pretty much it from today!
