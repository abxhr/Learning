## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

Today was quite tiring too (*this is slowly turning into and everyday thing, which I don't want it to*).

I had a meeting/interview today with Microsoft Reactor (*Abu Dhabi*). They had an opening for the role of a Cloud Advocate (*vendor*). The meeting/interview went pretty good TBH, but they were looking for someone to commit full-time, and I won't be able to do it right now. So I had to let it go.

I also worked on starting the literature review for my Project this semester on Computer Vision. For now, I've thought to work on Predicting Anomalies in Dermatologically Related Conditions using Computer Vision. 

That's it for **Day 25**! üöÄ
