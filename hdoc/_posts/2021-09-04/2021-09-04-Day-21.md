## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

So today was the last day before uni opened again (*for which I'm pretty excited :)*), and I thought to chill out a bit today too! üò¨

To start off the day, I worked a bit on Flutter, and tweaking the Quiz App that I created, just so that I don't lose the flow of learning Flutter. I also spent some time working and practicing on my JavaScript skills. 

After that, I tried to finalize my courses and timetable for the upcoming Semester, so that I don't mess anything up for the registration happening tomorrow.

Then, I had an amazing meeting with the squad from my club, *ACM*.

Later, I also worked a bit on the Discord bot I'm building, for an upcoming Discord Server. 

(*I have trouble assigning roles to members through the discord bot. If you are familiar with the discord api, let me know!*)

That was pretty much it for today. I'll sure put in much more work from tomorrow! üöÄ
