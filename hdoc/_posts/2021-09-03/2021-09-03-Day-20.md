## What did I do today? ‚ö°Ô∏è

I'll be completely honest; as it's my last weekend before university starts(*and endless sleepless nights + infinite stress*) again, I thought to take a small break today.

Let me tell you what I did today:

I spend alottt (*insert more t's to emphasize*) of my time today, playing Hitman 3, as I'm almost done with the game. (*Love the game!*)

Then I spent alot of my time, binging on the show *Community*. (*Slowly liking it too*)

And then, had a good chat with friends. We were supposed to talk about the electives we would be taking this semester, but the conversation kept going somewhere else (*like always*).

And that's pretty much all I did today. It was fun. Relaxing. 

It's sometimes really essential to take a break. Go out for a walk. Or play some game (*like I did*). Or talk to friends and family. Anything. That break could allow you to do your other tasks much better and efficient. 

That's it for **Day 20**. See you tomorrow! üöÄ
